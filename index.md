# Experiencing Death

It is said that in death, all things become clear; Ensei Tankado now knew it was
true. As he clutched his chest and fell to the ground in pain, he realized the
horror of his mistake.

People appeared, hovering over him, trying to help. But Tankado did not want
help—it was too late for that.

Trembling, he raised his left hand and held his fingers outward. Look at my
hand! The faces around him stared, but he could tell they did not understand.   

On his finger was an engraved golden ring. For an instant, the markings
glimmered in the Andalusian sun. Ensei Tankado knew it was the last light he
would ever see.

Suddenly, without warning, the German’s body arched, stiffened, and almost
immediately collapsed on top of her. That's all? she thought, surprised and
relieved.

She tried to slide out from under him. "Darling," she whispered huskily. "Let me
get on top." But the man did not move.

She reached up and pushed at his massive shoulders. "Darling, I . . . I can't
breathe!" She began feeling faint. She felt her ribs cracking. "¡Despiértate!"
Her fingers instinctively started pulling at his matted hair. _Wake up!_

It was then that she felt the warm sticky liquid. It was matted in his
hair—flowing onto her cheeks, into her mouth. It was salty. She twisted wildly
beneath him. Above her, a strange shaft of light illuminated the German's
contorted face. The bullet hole in his temple was gushing blood all over her.
She tried to scream, but there was no air left in her lungs. He was crushing
her.  Delirious, she clawed toward the shaft of light coming from the doorway.
She saw a hand. A gun with a silencer. A flash of light. And then nothing.

As the chopper rose to four thousand feet, it banked steeply out over a series
of ice chasms and crevasses. Suddenly, the men stood. Without a word, they
gripped the heavily laden sled and pushed it out the open door. Brophy watched
in horror as his dogs scrambled in vain against the enormous weight. In an
instant the animals disappeared, dragged howling out of the chopper.

Brophy was already on his feet screaming when the men grabbed him. They hauled
him to the door. Numb with fear, Brophy swung his fists, trying to fend off the
powerful hands pushing him outward.

It was no use. Moments later he was tumbling toward the chasms below.
