# Experiencing Death

It is said that in death, all things become clear; Ensei Tankado now knew it was
true. As he clutched his chest and fell to the ground in pain, he realized the
horror of his mistake.

People appeared, hovering over him, trying to help. But Tankado did not want
help—it was too late for that.

Trembling, he raised his left hand and held his fingers outward. Look at my
hand! The faces around him stared, but he could tell they did not understand.   

On his finger was an engraved golden ring. For an instant, the markings
glimmered in the Andalusian sun. Ensei Tankado knew it was the last light he
would ever see.

Suddenly, without warning, the German’s body arched, stiffened, and almost
immediately collapsed on top of her. That's all? she thought, surprised and
relieved.

She tried to slide out from under him. "Darling," she whispered huskily. "Let me
get on top." But the man did not move.

She reached up and pushed at his massive shoulders. "Darling, I . . . I can't
breathe!" She began feeling faint. She felt her ribs cracking. "¡Despiértate!"
Her fingers instinctively started pulling at his matted hair. _Wake up!_

It was then that she felt the warm sticky liquid. It was matted in his
hair—flowing onto her cheeks, into her mouth. It was salty. She twisted wildly
beneath him. Above her, a strange shaft of light illuminated the German's
contorted face. The bullet hole in his temple was gushing blood all over her.
She tried to scream, but there was no air left in her lungs. He was crushing
her.  Delirious, she clawed toward the shaft of light coming from the doorway.
She saw a hand. A gun with a silencer. A flash of light. And then nothing.

As the chopper rose to four thousand feet, it banked steeply out over a series
of ice chasms and crevasses. Suddenly, the men stood. Without a word, they
gripped the heavily laden sled and pushed it out the open door. Brophy watched
in horror as his dogs scrambled in vain against the enormous weight. In an
instant the animals disappeared, dragged howling out of the chopper.

Brophy was already on his feet screaming when the men grabbed him. They hauled
him to the door. Numb with fear, Brophy swung his fists, trying to fend off the
powerful hands pushing him outward.

It was no use. Moments later he was tumbling toward the chasms below.

The fear came on in torrents now.

Drowning, Ming had once read, was the most horrific death imaginable. He had
never dreamed he would find himself on the verge of experiencing it. His muscles
refused to cooperate with his mind, and already he was fighting just to keep his
head above water. His soggy clothing pulled him downward as his numb fingers
scratched the sides of the pit.


His screams were only in his mind now.

And then it happened.

Ming went under. The sheer terror of being conscious of his own impending death
was something he never imagined he would experience. And yet here he was…sinking
slowly down the sheer ice wall of a two-hundred-foot-deep hole in the ice.
Multitudes of thoughts flashed before his eyes. Moments from his childhood. His
career. He wondered if anyone would find him down here. Or would he simply sink
to the bottom and freeze there…entombed in the glacier for all time.

Ming's lungs were screaming for oxygen. He held his breath, still trying to kick
toward the surface. Breathe! He fought the reflex, clamping his insensate lips
together. Breathe! He tried in vain to swim upward. Breathe! At that instant, in
a deadly battle of human reflex against reason, Ming’s breathing instinct
overcame his ability to keep his mouth closed.

Wailee Ming inhaled.

The water crashing into his lungs felt like scalding oil on his sensitive
pulmonary tissue. He felt like he was burning from the inside out. Cruelly,
water does not kill immediately. Ming spent seven horrifying seconds inhaling in
the icy water, each breath more painful than the last, each inhalation offering
none of what his body so desperately craved.

Finally, as Ming slid downward into the icy darkness, he felt himself going
unconscious. He welcomed the escape. All around him in the water Ming saw tiny
glowing specks of light. It was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen.

The sharks hit instantly. From her front-row seat, Rachel sat frozen in place as
the spectacle unfolded only a few feet away.

Delta-Two felt the shark’s oblong head crash into him with unimaginable force. A
razor sharp clamp tightened on his upper arm, slicing to the bone and locking
on. A flash of white-hot pain exploded as the shark torqued its powerful body
and shook its head violently, tearing Delta-Two’s arm off his body.

Others sharks moved in. Knives stabbing at his legs. Torso. Neck. Delta-Two had
no breath to scream in agony as the sharks ripped huge chunks of his body away.
The last thing he saw was a crescent-shaped mouth, tilting sideways, a gorge of
teeth clamping down across his face.

The world went black.
